The 'ok' flag...
==================================================

The vector 'clauses[]' store all clauses of size >= 2, the vector
'assigns[]' store clauses of size 1, the boolean 'ok' stores clauses
of size 0 -- and there is only one such clause, the empty clause, so
in other words, 'ok' stores "is there an empty clause or not".
