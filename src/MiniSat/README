MiniSat v1.14 / MiniSat-p v1.14
========================================

This version is a cleaned up version of the MiniSat solver entering
the SAT 2005 competition.  Some of the most low-level optimization has
been removed for the sake of clarity, resulting in a 5-10% performance
degradation. The guard on "too-many-calls" in 'simplifyDB()' has also
been improved. If uttermost performance is needed, use the competition
version, also available at the MiniSat page
(www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/FormalMethods/MiniSat/).

Several things has changed inside MiniSat since the first version,
documented in the paper "An Extensible SAT Solver". The most important
is the lack of support for non-clausal constraints in this
version. Please use MiniSat v1.12b if you need this. Other changes are
special treatment of binary clauses for efficiency (messes up the code
a bit, but gives quite a speedup), improved variable order (still
VSIDS based, but works MUCH better than in previous MiniSat
versions!), conflict clause minimization (by Niklas S
